# Python-Challenge
Module 3, Python
In this assignment, I was given two Python challenges which were PyBank and PyPoll, in this task I had to use the concepts I had learned over the week. 
For the PyBank challenge, I had to create a Python Script which would analyze the financial records of my company. I was also given a dataset named budget_data.csv which contained 2 columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". 
For the PyPoll challenge, I had to help a small, rural, U.S. town develop its vote-counting process. I was also given a dataset named election_data.csv, which contained 3 columns Vote ID, County, and Candidate.
During this challenge, I had to review the class recording again as I was struggling I also watched a few youtube videos to help me but I think going back to the recordings and doing the task again was very helpful.
